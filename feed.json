There are some different ways this is achieved:</p>\n<h4 id=\"passive-does-not-require-energy\">Passive (does not require energy):</h4>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Diffusion]\nThe net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration down a concentration gradient. The steeper the concentration gradient, the faster diffusion occurs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Osmosis]\nThe net movement of <strong>free water particles</strong> from an area of <em>High Water Potential</em> to a lower <em>Lower Water Potential</em> ==<strong>Through a semi-permeable membrane</strong>== down a water potential gradient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"active-requires-energy\">Active (requires energy):</h4>\n<p>Active transport requires energy. This energy is gathered from Respiration.</p>\n<p>It is the movement of particles from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. It requires energy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Note]</p>\n<h5 id=\"how-active-transport-works\">How active transport works:</h5>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Substance</strong> enters <strong>Binding</strong> site of <strong>carrier protein</strong>.</li>\n<li>Energy <em>From Respiration</em> is used to change the shape of the protein.</li>\n<li><strong>Carrier protein</strong> releases substance on other side of Cell Membrane.</li>\n<li>The carrier protein returns to its original shape.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This process happens in plant root hair cells, which is why they have a lot of mitochondria.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cells-in-solution\">Cells in Solution:</h3>\n<p>Cells, when present in solution, act in very different ways. This is to do with Osmosis and diffusion.</p>\n<h4 id=\"isotonic-solutions\">Isotonic Solutions:</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Isotonic: Definition]\nAn Isotonic solution is one in which the <strong>Water Potential</strong> inside and outside of the cell is the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an isotonic solution, a cell will be <strong>flaccid</strong>, or floppy.</p>\n<p>This is because the <strong>Water Potential</strong> inside and outside of the cell is equal, so there is no <strong>net</strong> movement of free water particles.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hypertonic-solutions\">Hypertonic Solutions:</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Hypertonic: definition]\nA hypertonic solution is one in which the <strong>water potential</strong> inside of the cell is much higher than the water potential outside of the cell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a Hypertonic Solution, a cell will become <em>plasmolysed</em>, meaning that the cell membrane will split away from the cell wall.</p>\n<p>This is because the osmotic movement will lead to the movement of free water particles out of the cell, as the water potential is higher inside of the cell than outside of the cell.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hypotonic-solutions\">Hypotonic Solutions:</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Hypotonic: Definition]\nA hypotonic solution is one in which the water potential inside of the cell is lower than that outside the cell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a hypotonic solution, the cell will become turgid.</p>\n<p>This is because free water particles will move from the solution into the cell, as the water potential inside of the cell is much lower than the water potential inside of the cell.</p>\n<p>This helps the plant not Wilt</p>\n<h3 id=\"root-hair-cells\">Root Hair Cells:</h3>\n<h4 id=\"taking-up-water\">Taking Up Water:</h4>\n<p>Root Hair cells need to take up water, so that the cells of a plant can be in a hypotonic solution at all times, this enables them to remain turgid, and stops the plant from wilting. Water is also required for processes such as Photosynthesis.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Root hair cells increase the surface area of the rooot</li>\n<li>Inside the cells is a <strong>low</strong> water potential.</li>\n<li>Outside the cells is a <strong>high</strong> water potential.</li>\n<li>The free water particles enter the cell through <strong>Osmosis</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>They are adapted for this, as they have a large surface area.</p>\n<h4 id=\"taking-up-mineral-ions\">Taking Up Mineral Ions:</h4>\n<p>Root hair cells need to take up mineral ions from the <strong>humus</strong> and <strong>rock fragments</strong> in the soil, so that the plant can complete processes.</p>\n<p>To do this, <strong>Active Transport</strong> must occur. Active transport requires <strong>energy</strong>. To be able to provide this energy:</p>\n<p>The root hair cell is adapted to have a <strong>lot</strong> of <em>mitochondria</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"xylem-and-phloem-vessels\">Xylem and Phloem Vessels:</h3>\n<p>Xylem and Phloem vessels are the two types of plant vessel. They are grouped together in areas called Vascular bundles.</p>\n<h4 id=\"xylem\">Xylem:</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Xylem Vessels]\nTransport water and mineral ions from the roots to the rest of the plant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"adaptations\">Adaptations:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>They have <strong>no end walls</strong> between each cell, allowing the water and dissolved mineral ions to flow through each cell, onto the next.</li>\n<li>Their walls are made of <strong>lignin</strong>. They are <strong>dead</strong>, but this provides structural stability, and makes them <em>waterproof</em>.</li>\n<li>One way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"phloem-vessels\">Phloem vessels.</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Phloem Vessels]\nPhloem vessels transport the products of photosynthesis and Amino acids from the leaves to around the plant</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"adaptations-1\">Adaptations:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>They are made up of <strong>two main parts</strong>:<ul>\n<li>The Sieve Tubes:<ul>\n<li>Full of <em>Cytoplasm</em></li>\n<li>Have sieve-plates, containing <strong>minute</strong> pores</li>\n<li>Are still <strong>living</strong></li>\n<li>Two-way</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Companion Cells:<ul>\n<li>Have <strong>nuclei</strong>, and so can control the Sieve tubes</li>\n<li>Are also living</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"transpiration\">Transpiration:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!Transpiration Definition]\nTranspiration is the <strong>Evaporation</strong> of <em>water</em>, followed by the <strong>diffusion</strong> of <em><strong>Water Vapour</strong></em> out of the Leaves through the Stomata.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Note]\nThe <strong>Movement of water</strong> is important to a <strong>leaf</strong> because water:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is required for Photosynthesis</li>\n<li>Carries Mineral Ions</li>\n<li>Keeps Cells Turgid</li>\n<li>helps the leaf cool down</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"factors-that-effect-transpiration\">Factors that Effect Transpiration:</h4>\n<h5 id=\"temperature\">Temperature:</h5>\n<p><strong>Higher</strong> Temperature leads to a <strong>Higher</strong> rate of transpiration.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As the <strong>temperature</strong> increases, the water particles in the leaf gain more energy.</li>\n<li>This leads them to <strong>evaporate</strong> more <em><strong>rapidly</strong></em></li>\n<li>The Particles have more <strong>kinetic Energy</strong>, so diffuse <em>faster</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5 id=\"humidity\">Humidity:</h5>\n<p><strong>Higher</strong> Humidity leads to a <em><strong>Lower</strong></em> rate of Transpiration.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As the <strong>Humiditu</strong> increases, there is more <strong>water vapour</strong> in the air.</li>\n<li>This means that the <em><strong>Concentration Gradient</strong></em> will be less steep.</li>\n<li>This will lead to <strong>slower</strong> diffusion.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5 id=\"air-speed\">Air Speed:</h5>\n<p><strong>Higher</strong> Air Speed leads to a <strong>higher</strong> rate of transpiration.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As the <strong>Air speed</strong> increases, water vapour is <em>blown away</em> from the area near the leaf.</li>\n<li>This <strong>increases</strong> the <em><strong>Concentration gradient</strong></em>.</li>\n<li>This leads to <em>faster</em> <strong>diffusion</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5 id=\"light-intensity\">Light Intensity:</h5>\n<p><strong>Higher</strong> light intensity leads to a <strong>higher</strong> rate of transpiration.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Stomata</strong> <em>open</em> when the <strong>ligth intensity</strong> is higher.</li>\n<li><em>More</em> Light leads to <em>more</em> open <strong>Stomata</strong>.</li>\n<li>Transpiration happens at a <em><strong>Faster rate</strong></em> as the water can evaporate and diffuse out of the leaf <em>easier</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Info]\nThere are <em>more</em> <strong>Stomata</strong> on the <strong>underside</strong> of a leaf, and the <strong>waxy cuticle</strong> on the top <em>prevents</em> water loss.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"the-potometer\">The Potometer:</h4>\n<p>The Potometer is an <strong>apparatus</strong> used to test the <strong>rate of transpiration</strong> in a plant.</p>\n<h5 id=\"considerations\">Considerations:</h5>\n<p>There are some considerations to make when doing this experiment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cut</strong> the plant <em><strong>Underwater</strong></em> to prevent <em>air bubbles</em> entering the <strong>Xylem</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make sure that the plant is <strong>tight</strong> in its connection to the capillary tube.<ul>\n<li>this avoids inaccurate readings for transpiration, as some water may evaporate away.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Resevoir</strong> is there to allow Repeats.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stomata\">Stomata:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Stomata: Definition]\nStomata are <strong>Pores</strong> on the <strong>underside</strong> of a <em>leaf</em> which are used for <strong>Transpiration</strong> and absorbing <strong>Carbon Dioxide</strong> and releasing <strong>Oxygen</strong>.
