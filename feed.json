After the air going over the wing rolls off of the back of the wing, it changes direction, so that it goes downwards[3] . This means that some of the ‘relative wind’ (the direction of the wind closest to the plane, near to the wings) points downwards, it is opposite to the direction that the plane is moving (e.g if a plane is moving forwards, the relative wind will be moving backwards, relative to the plane).</p>\n<p>This also known as the ‘oncoming airmass’.</p>\n<p>The force of lift always acts perpendicular to the relative wind[2]  [4].</p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc128689231\"></a><u>Why this causes the ground-effect:</u></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Usually, when an aircraft is in the air, the downwash leads to the relative wind pointing downwards, due to the deflection of the wind.</li>\n<li>lift acts perpendicular to the direction of relative wind.</li>\n<li>This leads to lift acting on the aircraft, but a slight amount backwards.\n<ul>\n<li>This effect is called ‘induced drag’.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When the plane’s wings are closer to the ground, downwash is smaller.

The intensity of the ground-effect relies on the wing’s distance from the ground, and its length. The wing’s length is important, as, the longer the wing, the more downwash will be produced, and the greater the reduction in induced drag will be[5] .</p>\n<p>Pilots need to be able to understand, and account for the ground-effect when landing and taking off. To do this, they need to know when the ground-effect begins to take effect. The ground effect takes place when the aircraft is within its wingspan-length above the ground. The closer you get to the ground, the more compressed the wing-tip-vortices become, and the aircraft experiences less induced drag.</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316205930.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: A graph showing decrease in induced drag with decrease in distance from the ground.\" width=\"700\" height=\"579\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205930-xs.png 300w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205930-sm.png 480w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205930-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Figure 3: A graph showing decrease in induced drag with decrease in distance from the ground.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Due to this, aircraft with lower wings experience the ground-effect to a higher extent.</p>\n<p>This effect can be harnessed, and combined with a few other technologies to enable vehicles specifically designed to use the ground-effect to be able to travel efficiently.</p>\n<p>During World War II, While flying long distances between islands in the Pacific, American B-29s sometimes experienced engine failures. To get back to where they would be safe, the crews often used the  ground-effect to conserve the fuel they had left, and increase their range[6] . As well as this, the Dornier DO-X (a large seaplane), when making its (only) transatlantic flight in 1930, flew only a few metres above the sea almost all the way, to conserve fuel[5] [7]</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316205947.png\" alt=\"Figure 4: A Dornier DO-X flying in the ground-effect.\" width=\"682\" height=\"399\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205947-xs.png 300w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205947-sm.png 480w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205947-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Figure 4: A Dornier DO-X flying in the ground-effect.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc128689232\"></a><u>Dangers:</u></h3>\n<p>Though the ground-effect may be useful at certain times, it can also have some drawbacks which a pilot may need to take into consideration when taking off, or landing.</p>\n<p>Pilots in traditional planes may overshoot the runway if not accounting for the ground effect, during take-off. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of October 1952, a De Havilland Comet could not take off, overran the runway, and had to terminate the landing[8] [9] . This happened because, when planes are in the ground-effect, the angle at which stalling happens is smaller (by 2 to 4 º), so planes can easily rotate too much while taking off, and stall[10] .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc128689233\"></a><u>Design</u></h1>\n<p>Ground effect vehicles have a couple of advantages over both normal aircraft, and land or sea vehicles (as well as some disadvantages).</p>\n<p>The major advantages include[6] :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are much more Efficient than traditional aircraft, due to the reduced induced drag they experience, allowing them to travel farther on the same amount of fuel.</li>\n<li>They are much faster than land vehicles or boats, and so are able to be much more practical in a variety of situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To effectively harness the ground-effect, vehicles must incorporate technologies which enable them to use the ground-effect as much as possible.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc128689234\"></a><u>Types of GEV</u></h2>\n<p>There are three main types of ground-effect vehicles[11] :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type A: An aircraft that is certified only to work when in the ground-effect.</li>\n<li>Type B: An aircraft that is certified to work in the ground-effect, and also temporarily fly to 150 Metres or under.</li>\n<li>Type C: An aircraft that is able to do the same as [Type B], but is also able to fly above 150 metres for short amounts of time, in an emergency, or to avoid obstacles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ground-effect vehicles are regulated, and certified by the International Maritime Organisation, as most of them fly over only water. This is because open water tends to be relatively smooth (the ground-effect works best over a smooth surface) and have few, or easily seen and avoidable obstacles. Due to this, they fall under the IMO’s regulation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc128689235\"></a><u>Wing Shapes</u></h2>\n<p>Ground-effect vehicles usually have one of three wing shapes, each of which is useful in different situations.</p>\n<p>The first of these is the earliest, and most simplistic – the straight-wing design. This design lends itself well to larger GEVs, as it is made up of two wings, like a normal plane. However, these wings are usually short and broad. GEVs with the straight-wing design are not very stable, and need a large tail to act as a stabiliser. Aircraft using this design tend to be vertically stable[12] . This design is notable, as it was used in the design of the Ekranoplane.</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316210030.png\" alt=\"Figure 5: A Straight-wing GEV\" width=\"1055\" height=\"591\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210030-xs.png 300w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210030-sm.png 480w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210030-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Figure 5: A Straight-wing GEV</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>GEVs can also have ‘Tandem’ wings. These are a pair of wings, and can be arranged in a variety of positions around the body of the aircraft. Most modern Tandem-wing GEVs have one pair of wings at the front, and one pair of wings at the back. This configuration allows for higher (longitudinal) stability [12], and so is used much more in lightweight, smaller GEVs – the type of aircraft that are being developed a lot more in the modern day. This design is notable because it was used by Günther Jörg in his tandem-airfoil Flairboat [13] .</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316210043.png\" alt=\"Figure 6: A tandem-wing GEV\" width=\"1026\" height=\"608\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210043-xs.png 300w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210043-sm.png 480w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210043-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Figure 6: A tandem-wing GEV</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The last type of wing configuration is the reverse delta wing. This design also employs a large tail for stability, the wings are also often very broad. This design is very stable, and also allows flight for short distances at a higher altitude, making it useful for type B GEVs[14] .

However, the ground effect was not well understood, and so many people investigated it to try and see how it worked. In 1934, the USA national advisory committee for aeronautics translated French research, ‘<em>Ground Effect on the Take-off and Landing of Airplanes</em> ’[15] .  In it, the author Maurice le Sueur suggests that the effect could be used as a, ‘rapid and at the same time economic form of locomotion’[16, p. 24/25] . After this report was published, the awareness and possibilities of the ground-effect became much more widespread, though it was still restricted to select aeronautical circles.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc128689237\"></a><u>The Ekranoplanes</u></h2>\n<p>The Soviet Union was always looking for new innovations that could help them prove that they were superior than the West, Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, and was especially drawn to innovative and novel projects and ideas [17] .</p>\n<p>Rostislav Alexeyev was the director and chief designer of the Central Hydrofoil Bureau, he had designed boats using hydrofoils for the Soviet Union previously, such as the Raketa[18] . He had had an idea to lift a boat’s hydrofoil out of the water, enabling it to use the ground-effect to fly above the water, quickly, yet efficiently. He began testing the concept out with small scale models of his design, but needed more funding to make his designs in real life.</p>\n<p>He called these designs ‘Ekranoplanes’, or ‘screen planes’, after the Russian name for the ground-effect – the screen effect.</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316211125.png\" alt=\"Figure 8: A scale model of an Ekranoplane being tested.\" width=\"550\" height=\"405\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211125-xs.png 300w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211125-sm.png 480w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211125-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Figure 8: A scale model of an Ekranoplane being tested.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Alexeyev managed to secure the funding by showing that his ekranoplanes could be useful to the Military. They easily avoided mines, as they flew above the water, were much more efficient, and could carry higher loads than aeroplanes, and could also go much faster than ships. Crucially, Ekranoplanes could avoid both SONAR, and RADAR, as they flew too low to be detected by RADAR, and completely out of the water, so, to SONAR, they were invisible.</p>\n<p>To the USSR’s military officials, the ground-effect was the future.</p>\n<p>After receiving the funding, Alexeyev and his team Made Small prototypes to dip their toes into building Ekranoplanes, and prove that their ideas were feasible. On the 22nd July 1961, Alexeyev and his team set their first prototype, the ‘samokhodnaya model-1’[19] - or ‘self-propelled model’ - onto the Caspian sea, and started their first test-flight.</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316211140.png\" alt=\"Figure 9: The SM-1\" width=\"400\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211140-xs.png 300w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211140-sm.png 480w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211140-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Figure 9: The SM-1</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Using the lessons learnt from the SM-1, the team built the SM-2.

By this time, the Soviet Union had a new leader, Leonid Brezhnev, who was much more sceptical of unproven concepts[17]  and who decided to stop the Ekranoplane project. However, he let a few projects, already nearing their ends, finish.</p>\n<p>This project was the A-90 Orlyonok (meaning eaglet). This was a much smaller Ekranoplane, weighing 140 tonnes and measuring 58 metres long, and was a Class B/C GEV, having one turbroprop engine, and two turbojet engines, with which it could travel at up to 400km/h. It could fly at altitudes much higher, but normally flew 200-400m above the surface of the water [23] It was capable of crossing the Caspian sea, carrying roughly 100 troops, which would be its main function[23]. Five Orlyonoks were made but only four entered service in 1979, In 1993, they were taken out of service with only three remaining [23] .

A plane he designed; the Bartini Stal-7 broke the international speed record in 1936. In the 1950s, He grew increasingly interested in GEVs, and developed a small GEV of his own, the Beriev Be-1, though it was seen as not useful, and only one was ever made[26] .</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316211312.png\" alt=\"Figure 15: The Beriev Be-1\" width=\"447\" height=\"223\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211312-xs.png 300w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211312-sm.png 480w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211312-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Figure 15: The Beriev Be-1</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Bartini then began on one of the most ambitious aircraft projects in history. The Soviet Union needed an aircraft that could be an anti-submarine aircraft, to combat the USA’s Polaris Missile submarines. Bartini developed a concept that could take off and land vertically, use the ground effect, and land in water, to completely fulfil the requirements needed[27] . The Soviet Military liked the idea, and began supporting</p>\n<p>The aircraft was named the Bartini Beriev VVA-14 (for vertical take-off amphibious aircraft ), and research was begun.</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316211405.png\" alt=\"Figure 16: The Planned design for the VVA-14\" width=\"372\" height=\"280\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211405-xs.png 300w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211405-sm.png 480w ,https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316211405-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Figure 16: The Planned design for the VVA-14</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Three prototypes were to be built: one just to see how well it could fly as well as its inflatable pontoons, the other to test out the 12 lift-jets and the last with the anti-submarine weapons.</p>\n<p>However, the pontoons ended up being much harder to get to deploy properly, and so temporary metal ballasts were fitted instead[27] . The first prototype was the only one ever built, and was capable of flying, with it being able to stay 8m above the sea when in ground-effect .</p>\n<p>However, one of the main aspects of the entire design – the lift jets that would enable VTOL – could not be produced, as the engine company that was given the task of making them was both overburdened with other projects, and could not make any engines powerful enough for the VVA-14.</p>\n<p> Bartini had hopes for a flying aircraft-carrier, but, due to the lack of promise in the VVA-14 project, as well as other GEV projects, it was never considered.

            "content_html": "<p>Lonely Castle in the Mirror by Mizuki Tsujimura is a very interesting book. At first, it seems to be quite a childish book, written simply and conveying a story which is almost definitely not something <em>Serious Fantasy</em> would ever stoop down to. However, as you delve deeper into the book, you start to see elements which do not fit, and, slowly, you realise that what you are reading is a corrupted fairytale, modernised, mysterious, with dark corners. It is not hard to tell that Tsujimura has also written mysteries, as, at the core of the story is one such mystery. <br><br>The characters are all children of varying ages who enter a strange castle through mirrors in their school, called by a strange girl called the wolf queen. Each of the characters is explored, with each of their seemingly bizarre character traits explained through close inspection. The main character, Kokoro is handled especially well, and the empathy with all of the children are depicted with does not let down the social-commentary side of the book (which definitely is not the focus of the book). The ending is by far the best part of the book, a wonderful denouement in which everything is explained, and the emotional punches are packed into an incredibly tense section of the book. The book also manages to pull off a wonderfully complex faux time-travel reveal at the end, all of which comes together to produce a thoroughly enjoyable book. </p>",

There are some different ways this is achieved:</p>\n<h4 id=\"passive-does-not-require-energy\">Passive (does not require energy):</h4>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Diffusion]\nThe net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration down a concentration gradient. The steeper the concentration gradient, the faster diffusion occurs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Osmosis]\nThe net movement of <strong>free water particles</strong> from an area of <em>High Water Potential</em> to a lower <em>Lower Water Potential</em> ==<strong>Through a semi-permeable membrane</strong>== down a water potential gradient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"active-requires-energy\">Active (requires energy):</h4>\n<p>Active transport requires energy. This energy is gathered from Respiration.</p>\n<p>It is the movement of particles from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. It requires energy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Note]</p>\n<h5 id=\"how-active-transport-works\">How active transport works:</h5>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Substance</strong> enters <strong>Binding</strong> site of <strong>carrier protein</strong>.</li>\n<li>Energy <em>From Respiration</em> is used to change the shape of the protein.</li>\n<li><strong>Carrier protein</strong> releases substance on other side of Cell Membrane.</li>\n<li>The carrier protein returns to its original shape.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This process happens in plant root hair cells, which is why they have a lot of mitochondria.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cells-in-solution\">Cells in Solution:</h3>\n<p>Cells, when present in solution, act in very different ways. This is to do with Osmosis and diffusion.</p>\n<h4 id=\"isotonic-solutions\">Isotonic Solutions:</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Isotonic: Definition]\nAn Isotonic solution is one in which the <strong>Water Potential</strong> inside and outside of the cell is the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an isotonic solution, a cell will be <strong>flaccid</strong>, or floppy.</p>\n<p>This is because the <strong>Water Potential</strong> inside and outside of the cell is equal, so there is no <strong>net</strong> movement of free water particles.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hypertonic-solutions\">Hypertonic Solutions:</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Hypertonic: definition]\nA hypertonic solution is one in which the <strong>water potential</strong> inside of the cell is much higher than the water potential outside of the cell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a Hypertonic Solution, a cell will become <em>plasmolysed</em>, meaning that the cell membrane will split away from the cell wall.</p>\n<p>This is because the osmotic movement will lead to the movement of free water particles out of the cell, as the water potential is higher inside of the cell than outside of the cell.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hypotonic-solutions\">Hypotonic Solutions:</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Hypotonic: Definition]\nA hypotonic solution is one in which the water potential inside of the cell is lower than that outside the cell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a hypotonic solution, the cell will become turgid.</p>\n<p>This is because free water particles will move from the solution into the cell, as the water potential inside of the cell is much lower than the water potential inside of the cell.</p>\n<p>This helps the plant not Wilt</p>\n<h3 id=\"root-hair-cells\">Root Hair Cells:</h3>\n<h4 id=\"taking-up-water\">Taking Up Water:</h4>\n<p>Root Hair cells need to take up water, so that the cells of a plant can be in a hypotonic solution at all times, this enables them to remain turgid, and stops the plant from wilting. Water is also required for processes such as Photosynthesis.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Root hair cells increase the surface area of the rooot</li>\n<li>Inside the cells is a <strong>low</strong> water potential.</li>\n<li>Outside the cells is a <strong>high</strong> water potential.</li>\n<li>The free water particles enter the cell through <strong>Osmosis</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>They are adapted for this, as they have a large surface area.</p>\n<h4 id=\"taking-up-mineral-ions\">Taking Up Mineral Ions:</h4>\n<p>Root hair cells need to take up mineral ions from the <strong>humus</strong> and <strong>rock fragments</strong> in the soil, so that the plant can complete processes.</p>\n<p>To do this, <strong>Active Transport</strong> must occur. Active transport requires <strong>energy</strong>.
