It can occur during take-off, or landing, and even affects helicopters.</p><h2><a name="_Toc128689230"></a><u>Reasons</u></h2><p>The Ground Effect occurs because, as an aircraft approaches the ground, the vortices of air that had formed around the tips of the wings are disrupted, as the vortexes hit the ground, and so are forced to be smaller [2].</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316205513.png" alt="_Figure 1: Small Wing-Tip-Vortices closer to the ground, less downwash._" width="724" height="273" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205513-xs.png 300w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205513-sm.png 480w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205513-md.png 768w"></figure><figcaption>Figure 1: Small Wing-Tip-Vortices closer to the ground, less downwash.</figcaption></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316205540.png" alt="Figure 2: Large wing-tip-vortices in flight, more downwash." width="726" height="273" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205540-xs.png 300w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205540-sm.png 480w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205540-md.png 768w"><figcaption>Figure 2: Large wing-tip-vortices in flight, more downwash.</figcaption></figure><p>As the wing-tip-vortices get smaller, they lead to less downwash. After the air going over the wing rolls off of the back of the wing, it changes direction, so that it goes downwards[3] . This means that some of the ‘relative wind’ (the direction of the wind closest to the plane, near to the wings) points downwards, it is opposite to the direction that the plane is moving (e.g if a plane is moving forwards, the relative wind will be moving backwards, relative to the plane).</p><p>This also known as the ‘oncoming airmass’.</p><p>The force of lift always acts perpendicular to the relative wind[2]  [4].</p><h3><a name="_Toc128689231"></a><u>Why this causes the ground-effect:</u></h3><ul><li>Usually, when an aircraft is in the air, the downwash leads to the relative wind pointing downwards, due to the deflection of the wind.</li><li>lift acts perpendicular to the direction of relative wind.</li><li>This leads to lift acting on the aircraft, but a slight amount backwards.<ul><li>This effect is called ‘induced drag’.</li></ul></li><li>When the plane’s wings are closer to the ground, downwash is smaller.

The intensity of the ground-effect relies on the wing’s distance from the ground, and its length. The wing’s length is important, as, the longer the wing, the more downwash will be produced, and the greater the reduction in induced drag will be[5] .</p><p>Pilots need to be able to understand, and account for the ground-effect when landing and taking off. To do this, they need to know when the ground-effect begins to take effect. The ground effect takes place when the aircraft is within its wingspan-length above the ground. The closer you get to the ground, the more compressed the wing-tip-vortices become, and the aircraft experiences less induced drag.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316205930.png" alt="Figure 3: A graph showing decrease in induced drag with decrease in distance from the ground." width="700" height="579" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205930-xs.png 300w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205930-sm.png 480w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205930-md.png 768w"></figure><figcaption>Figure 3: A graph showing decrease in induced drag with decrease in distance from the ground.</figcaption></figure><p>Due to this, aircraft with lower wings experience the ground-effect to a higher extent.</p><p>This effect can be harnessed, and combined with a few other technologies to enable vehicles specifically designed to use the ground-effect to be able to travel efficiently.</p><p>During World War II, While flying long distances between islands in the Pacific, American B-29s sometimes experienced engine failures. To get back to where they would be safe, the crews often used the  ground-effect to conserve the fuel they had left, and increase their range[6] . As well as this, the Dornier DO-X (a large seaplane), when making its (only) transatlantic flight in 1930, flew only a few metres above the sea almost all the way, to conserve fuel[5] [7]</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316205947.png" alt="Figure 4: A Dornier DO-X flying in the ground-effect." width="682" height="399" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205947-xs.png 300w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205947-sm.png 480w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316205947-md.png 768w"></figure><figcaption>Figure 4: A Dornier DO-X flying in the ground-effect.</figcaption></figure><h3><a name="_Toc128689232"></a><u>Dangers:</u></h3><p>Though the ground-effect may be useful at certain times, it can also have some drawbacks which a pilot may need to take into consideration when taking off, or landing.</p><p>Pilots in traditional planes may overshoot the runway if not accounting for the ground effect, during take-off. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of October 1952, a De Havilland Comet could not take off, overran the runway, and had to terminate the landing[8] [9] . This happened because, when planes are in the ground-effect, the angle at which stalling happens is smaller (by 2 to 4 º), so planes can easily rotate too much while taking off, and stall[10] .</p><p> </p><h1><a name="_Toc128689233"></a><u>Design</u></h1><p>Ground effect vehicles have a couple of advantages over both normal aircraft, and land or sea vehicles (as well as some disadvantages).</p><p>The major advantages include[6] :</p><ul><li>They are much more Efficient than traditional aircraft, due to the reduced induced drag they experience, allowing them to travel farther on the same amount of fuel.</li><li>They are much faster than land vehicles or boats, and so are able to be much more practical in a variety of situations.</li></ul><p>To effectively harness the ground-effect, vehicles must incorporate technologies which enable them to use the ground-effect as much as possible.</p><h2><a name="_Toc128689234"></a><u>Types of GEV</u></h2><p>There are three main types of ground-effect vehicles[11] :</p><ul><li>Type A: An aircraft that is certified only to work when in the ground-effect.</li><li>Type B: An aircraft that is certified to work in the ground-effect, and also temporarily fly to 150 Metres or under.</li><li>Type C: An aircraft that is able to do the same as [Type B], but is also able to fly above 150 metres for short amounts of time, in an emergency, or to avoid obstacles.</li></ul><p>Ground-effect vehicles are regulated, and certified by the International Maritime Organisation, as most of them fly over only water. This is because open water tends to be relatively smooth (the ground-effect works best over a smooth surface) and have few, or easily seen and avoidable obstacles. Due to this, they fall under the IMO’s regulation.</p><h2><a name="_Toc128689235"></a><u>Wing Shapes</u></h2><p>Ground-effect vehicles usually have one of three wing shapes, each of which is useful in different situations.</p><p>The first of these is the earliest, and most simplistic – the straight-wing design. This design lends itself well to larger GEVs, as it is made up of two wings, like a normal plane. However, these wings are usually short and broad. GEVs with the straight-wing design are not very stable, and need a large tail to act as a stabiliser. Aircraft using this design tend to be vertically stable[12] . This design is notable, as it was used in the design of the Ekranoplane.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316210030.png" alt="Figure 5: A Straight-wing GEV" width="1055" height="591" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210030-xs.png 300w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210030-sm.png 480w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210030-md.png 768w"></figure><figcaption>Figure 5: A Straight-wing GEV</figcaption></figure><p>GEVs can also have ‘Tandem’ wings. These are a pair of wings, and can be arranged in a variety of positions around the body of the aircraft. Most modern Tandem-wing GEVs have one pair of wings at the front, and one pair of wings at the back. This configuration allows for higher (longitudinal) stability [12], and so is used much more in lightweight, smaller GEVs – the type of aircraft that are being developed a lot more in the modern day. This design is notable because it was used by Günther Jörg in his tandem-airfoil Flairboat [13] .</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/Pasted-image-20230316210043.png" alt="Figure 6: A tandem-wing GEV" width="1026" height="608" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210043-xs.png 300w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210043-sm.png 480w, https://therizinosaurus-cheloniformis.github.io/Life-in-Paper/media/posts/9/responsive/Pasted-image-20230316210043-md.png 768w"></figure><figcaption>Figure 6: A tandem-wing GEV</figcaption></figure><p>The last type of wing configuration is the reverse delta wing. This design also employs a large tail for stability, the wings are also often very broad. This design is very stable, and also allows flight for short distances at a higher altitude, making it useful for type B GEVs[14] .

However, the ground effect was not well understood, and so many people investigated it to try and see how it worked. In 1934, the USA national advisory committee for aeronautics translated French research, ‘<em>Ground Effect on the Take-off and Landing of Airplanes</em> ’[15] .  In it, the author Maurice le Sueur suggests that the effect could be used as a, ‘rapid and at the same time economic form of locomotion’[16, p. 24/25] .

They easily avoided mines, as they flew above the water, were much more efficient, and could carry higher loads than aeroplanes, and could also go much faster than ships.
